/**
 * Exercise 5 - Default Methods
 * <p>
 * The introduction of Default Methods is intended to allow for libraries to evolve more easily - with the
 * JDK Collections library as their first main user. They permit adding concrete methods, with an implementation,
 * to Java interfaces. Prior to JDK 8, every method on an interface had to be abstract, with implementations provided
 * by classes. With JDK 8, it's possible to declare the following interface:
 * <p/>
 * <code>
 * <pre>
 * // (stripped down version of the real Iterable.java)
 * public interface Iterable<T> {
 *
 *     Iterator<T> iterator(); // As in prior versions
 *
 *     // example of a new JDK 8 default method
 *     default void forEach(Consumer<? super T> action) {
 *         Objects.requireNonNull(action);
 *         for (T t : this) {
 *             action.accept(t);
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * </code>
 * In this case the method <code>forEach</code> is a <em>default method</em> with a concrete implementation. With this
 * declaration <code>forEach()</code> can be invoked on any implementation of <code>Iterable</code>. This is very
 * similar to adding a concrete method to an abstract class -- if no implementation overrides it, the code in the method
 * on the interface is executed. Crucially, the new method can be added without causing compiler errors in the client
 * code. Consider if a normal <code>forEach</code> method was added to <code>Iterable</code>: every class that
 * implemented the <code>Iterable</code> interface would now fail to compile. Using default methods, the interface can
 * be evolved without breaking client code.
 * <p>
 * Allowing evolution of a library is the primary use case of default methods.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <h3>Rules of Method Lookup</h3>
 * <br>
 * Inheritance of method implementations is not new to Java. When a subclass method is invoked, the runtime finds the
 * nearest implementation available. This could be declared on the subclass itself, or on any of it's superclasses, or
 * even all the way up in <code>java.lang.Object</code>. This last case is what occurs if your class does not override
 * <code>toString</code>. However, if anywhere in the inheritance hierarchy from your class to Object, toString is
 * implemented, that would be executed instead of Object's toString. This behaviour is still in
 * place in JDK 8, but has been augmented to cope with default methods.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The main difference between superclass methods and default methods in JDK 8 is that there is only <em>single
 * inheritance</em> of classes, while there is <em>multiple inheritance</em> of interfaces. As such, there needs to be
 * some extra rules around method lookup.
 * <br>
 * Method lookup has all the following characteristics:
 * <br>
 * <h4>For a default method to be invoked, there must be no declaration anywhere in the class hierarchy.</h4>
 * <br>
 * This can
 * be thought of like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miranda_warning">Miranda rights</a>, as in, "You have
 * the right to a method implementation. If your class hierarchy cannot afford an implementation, one will be
 * provided for you". A method implementation anywhere in the class hierarchy will take priority over a default
 * method. This also applies to default methods which match the signature from java.lang.Object; the default method
 * can never be invoked. As such, declaring a default method which matches a method from Object is a compiler error.
 * <br>
 * <h4>The closest default method wins.</h4>
 * <br>
 * As with superclasses, when searching for a concrete method the nearest
 * superclass wins. For example, given "<code>class A</code>", "<code>class B extends A</code>", and "<code>class C
 * extends B</code>", if a method is invoked on C, the Java runtime will first look for the implementation in C,
 * then B, then A, then finally java.lang.Object, invoking the first method it finds. This is also the case with
 * super-interfaces. Indeed, given "<code>interface X</code>", "<code>interface Y extends X</code>" and "<code>
 * interface Z extends Y</code>", and declaring "<code>class C extends B, implements Z</code>", the lookup for a
 * default method would traverse the hierarchy in the following order: C -> B -> A -> Object -> Z -> Y -> X.
 * <br>
 * <h4>Ambiguous inheritance of a default method must be resolved in the implementing class, at compile time.</h4>
 * <br>
 * If a class inherits the same default method from more than one source, a compiler error will be emitted. This happens
 * when unrelated types declare the same method signature, and a class becomes a subtype of more than one of them.
 * Consider the following example:
 * <code><pre>
 * interface A {
 *     default void speak() { System.out.println("A says hi!"; }
 * }
 * interface B {
 *     default void speak() { System.out.println("Regards from B!"; }
 * }
 * class C implements A, B { } // compiler error: inherits unrelated default methods from A and B
 * </pre></code>
 * This principle applies regardless of how deep the interface inheritance hierarchy is, and also applies to
 * sub-interfaces as well as classes, i.e. "<code>interface Y extends A, B</code>" results in the same compile error.
 * This error can be resolved by removing ambiguity in the subtype, by overriding the default method. This can be any
 * compliant implementation, including directly invoking a specific inherited default method. A new syntax in JDK 8 is
 * available to allow choosing an inherited default method, like so:
 * <code><pre>
 * class C implements A, B {
 *     public void speak() { A.super.speak(); } // prints "A says hi!"
 * }
 * </pre></code>
 * In this case, when <code>instanceOfC.speak();</code> is executed, the default <code>speak</code> from <code>
 * interface A</code> is invoked. This syntax is also available within default method bodies, allowing an interface
 * to choose an implementation from one of its super-interfaces. Note that this syntax is not entirely unfamiliar: it
 * can be considered just like invoking <code>super.someMethod();</code>, except that with the single inheritance of
 * classes, the name of the super class is can be nothing other than the single superclass, so it can remain implicit.
 * <br>
 * It should be noted that ambiguities are <em>never</em> resolved by the order in which interface implementations are
 * declared (such as with Scala's traits). They must always be resolved explicitly in the subtype.
 * <p/>
 * <h3>Do default methods mean Java supports multiple inheritance?</h3>
 * <p>
 * In a way. Java has always supported multiple inheritance of interfaces, previously this did not include any of the
 * implementation, just the contract. Inheritance can be subdivided again, into inheritance of <em>state</em>, and
 * inheritance of <em>behaviour</em>. Default methods introduce the latter, multiple inheritance of behaviour.
 * <h4>What about the diamond problem?</h4>
 * <p>There are two aspects to the diamond problem: a) disambiguating implementations and b) handling state. We have seen
 * how ambiguities are resolved in JDK 8, requiring that users specify the implementation at compile time. Default
 * methods do not introduce a problem in that aspect of the diamond problem. The second problem, state, is where trickier
 * issues of the diamond problem live. It can be too easy to accidentally introduce bugs into an implementing class
 * because it must adhere to the contract defined in the interface and/or superclass, which can include maintaining
 * state. Any methods which manipulate that state must also be invoked in the implementing class, and accidentally
 * "losing" that invocation is an easy way to introduce a subtle bug. Also, there is the problem between the ordering of
 * conflicting methods, that cannot be resolved by disambiguating. Default methods in Java avoid this issue, due to an
 * existing virtue of interfaces, that <em>they do not contain state</em>. Because an interface cannot be constructed
 * with fields, there is no state available to encounter this issue. Java still has single inheritance of state,
 * through superclasses. If the contract of an interface requires state (like, e.g. <code>Iterator</code>) it will be
 * provided through the single inheritance chain.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note that there are still ways to "simulate" state in interfaces with default methods, since there is no restriction
 * on accessing static fields defined in other classes. However, that should be avoided for all the reasons that both
 * multiple inheritance of state, and global mutable state should be avoided.
 * </p>
